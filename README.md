**Dissociations in semantic relation cognition: Evidence of functional specialization for taxonomic and thematic relations with intracranial EEG oscillatory synchronization analysis**

&emsp;<br/>
- The type of semantic relations knowledge can be categorized as **taxonomic** relations, in which concepts are linked through the shared features (e.g., dog - cat), and **thematic** relations, in which concepts are connected through related events/scenarios (e.g., dog - leash). Existing studies have posited that the **anterior temporal lobe** (**ATL**) is functionally specialized for taxonomic relations and the **inferior parietal lobe** (**IPL**) for thematic relations, known as the **dual-hub model**. A recent sEEG study that supports the dual-hub hypothesis found more ATL engagement in retrieving taxonomic knowledge and more IPL engagement in retrieving thematic knowledge, with greater neural engagement indicated by reduced spectral power in the alpha (8-12Hz) and theta (4-7Hz) band, in an early and transient time window after stimulus onset. 

- The present study aims to use **intracranial EEG** provide a further neural indication for dual-hub theory by analyzing the within-region **phase synchronization** of in **ATL**, **IPL**, and two subregions of the **semantic control network** including inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG), as well as cross-region phase synchronization between the semantic hubs and semantic control regions.
